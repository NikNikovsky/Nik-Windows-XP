# NikWindowsXP*
This is my attempt at making a custom Windows XP installation

(The product key is **not** included)

I really hope we can get this to a state where it's either a separate distro or a Windows XP mod that can receive updates without manual installation (LegacyUpdate).

*Clarified with Grammarly, so you don't have to*
